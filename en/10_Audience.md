AUDIENCE


Aging population


It is a fact in most of the developing countries that the population average age is increasing. This also means that you should consider designing your applications for this growing and affluent group. An example can be eBook reader such as Amazon Kindle that is vastly popular in USA among senior citizens because of the following characteristics: it is super light and thin many senior people are avid readers and have time to read you can carry a number of books with you at all times the fonts are adjustable, bigger than book and easy to read ePaper battery lasts for weeks
In comparison iPad has not made the same impact on the same group because of weight, price, glossy screen and complexity of multiple applications.
Market Research and Focus Groups
We belive in making the best product we are able to using the best of our skills and intuition based on years of exprience. I don’t believe in biting more than we can chew, but rather in continous improvement. We believe in observing what people like in our products once we release them. We also like to see what others are making and spend long hours discussing what they did and how it could be done better.
Steve Jobs said it best: “Some people say, ‘Give the customers what they want.’ But that’s not my approach. Our job is to figure out what they’re going to want before they do. I think Henry Ford once said, ‘If I’d asked customers what they wanted, they would have told me, “A faster horse!”’ People don’t know what they want until you show it to them. That’s why I never rely on market research.
Our task is to read things that are not yet on the page.”
