# Sleep Science and Mobile Devices



Sleep is absolutely essential for healthy life. It has more influence on person's health than food consumed and the amount of exercise, therefore it should be an essential part of any wellness program.  

We do not fully understand all processes during sleep, but we have enough knowledge about the science of sleep to provide a general guidelines.

This article does not serve to detail the science of sleep in depth, but to provide a background information and lifestyle tips to improve personal wellness. This article is not a substitute for a professional health advise.

## Circadian Rhythm

Sleep is tightly related to circadian rhythm which for human is 24 hours, humans have evolved near the equator therefore the rhythm is divided into 12 hour day and night periods. The animals that evolved in arctic regions have specific adaptations. **(tip 1: adjust your day by scheduling 12 hours of day activity and 12 hours of night resting)** The rhythm is controlled by biological clock, which is a group of cells in the primitive part of brain called hypothalamus. The biological clock is working on the cellular level which means each cell has it, in fact all organisms, down to a single cell bacteria has a biological clock.

## Biological Clock

The biological clock in humans is controlled by light receptors in the eye. People who are exposed to constant light, or constant darkness get their biological clock severely disturbed which affects their ability to sleep. Not all blind people loose their circadian rhythm as vision is provided by rods and cones photoreceptors and the biological clock uses another set of photoreceptors called ganglion cells in the retina - blind person may not be aware that their brain sees the light. **(tip 2: maintain a contrast of day light and night darkness)**

## Color Spectrum

The light during the day has full color spectrum including blue, the sunrise and sunset are in the yellow to red color range, the brain responds to the composition of the light spectrum and adjusts circadian rythm accordingly. 

**(tip 3: Avoid natural, full spectrum light bulbs and LED lights during the 12 hour night rest period, use yellow light bulbs and dimmers instead)**

**(tip 4: At night, avoid TV and light emitting displays such as phones, if needed, change color balance to yellow, most devices support night mode and dim functions.)**

## Hormones

There are two hormones that are directly related to sleep Melatonin and Cortisol. 

### Melatonin

Melatonin is a sleep hormone that is secreted by pineal gland after dark with its peak in the middle of the night and it is almost entirely absent during the day. Melatonin is mostly controlled by the amount of light present and adjustment is slow. The amount and the timing of the melatonin is similar for the a person from night to night and this is a reason why people who change time zones experience jet lag over next few days.  

**(tip 5: Plan using bathroom which usually has bright, full spectrum light, well before going to sleep, or install yellow light to be used in the evening)**

### Cortisol

Cortisol is the stress hormone produced by adrenal glands above kidneys. Cortisol is closely related to quality of sleep. The levels of cortisol peak in regular intervals every hour during the day, in fact lack of these peaks leads to apathy. **(tip 6: Get up and walk around, talk to people at least once an hour during the day)** The cortisol peak levels should be much lower during the night, but stress can trigger them.

**(tip 7: Avoid stress before sleep, even minor triggers such as hot or cold shower can increase Cortisol levels for up to an hour)**

**(tip 8: instead of TV, or phone, read a book for 45 minutes in bed with soft yellow illumination)**

## Siesta

As already mentioned humans evolved in equatorial region where during the mid-day they had to take a break from the sun, during that period they enjoyed a relative safety as most of the predators rest in the shade. **(tip 9: Plan your siesta breaks, if possible take a short nap)**

## Night time stress level

Older people, new parents and people who cannot perceive the light may have problems with the Melatonin and Cortisol levels and therefore do not sleep well at night and take unscheduled naps during the day. Disturbed sleep is better than no sleep, but disturbance in the circadian rhythm may have cumulative effect on well being. **(tip 10: If you are not able to adjust your circadian rhythm naturally using light, try to lower your night time stress level)**
