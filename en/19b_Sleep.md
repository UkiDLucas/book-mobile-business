Sleep Science and Mobile Devices



Sleep is absolutely essential for healthy life. It has more influence on person's health than food consumed and the amount of exercise, therefore it should be an essential part of any wellness program.  

We do not fully understand all processes during sleep, but we have enough knowledge about the science of sleep to provide a general guidelines.

Sleep is tightly related to circadian rhythm which for human is 24 hours, humans have evolved near the equator therefore the rhythm is divided into 12 hour day and night periods. The animals that evolved in arctic regions have specific adaptations. The rhythm is controlled by biological clock, which is a group of cells in the primitive part of brain called hypothalamus. The biological clock is working on the cellular level which means each cell has it, in fact all organisms, down to a single cell bacteria has a biological clock.

The biological clock in humans is controlled by light receptors in the eye. People who are exposed to constant light, or constant darkness get their biological clock severely disturbed which affects their ability to sleep. Not all blind people loose their circadian rhythm as vision is provided by rods and cones photoreceptors and biological clock uses ganglion cells in the retina - blind person may not be aware that their brain sees the light.
