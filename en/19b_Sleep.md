Sleep Science and Mobile Devices



Sleep is absolutely essential for healthy life. It has more influence on person's health than food consumed and the amount of exercise, therefore it should be an essential part of any wellness program.  

We do not fully understand all processes during sleep, but we have enough knowledge about the science of sleep to provide a general guidelines.

This article does not serve to detail the science of sleep in depth, but to provide a background information and tips marked with (tip x) to improve person's wellness.

Sleep is tightly related to circadian rhythm which for human is 24 hours, humans have evolved near the equator therefore the rhythm is divided into 12 hour day and night periods. The animals that evolved in arctic regions have specific adaptations. **(tip 1: adjust your day to 12 hours of day activity and 12 hours of night rest)** The rhythm is controlled by biological clock, which is a group of cells in the primitive part of brain called hypothalamus. The biological clock is working on the cellular level which means each cell has it, in fact all organisms, down to a single cell bacteria has a biological clock.

The biological clock in humans is controlled by light receptors in the eye. People who are exposed to constant light, or constant darkness get their biological clock severely disturbed which affects their ability to sleep. Not all blind people loose their circadian rhythm as vision is provided by rods and cones photoreceptors and biological clock uses ganglion cells in the retina - blind person may not be aware that their brain sees the light. **(tip 2: maintain a contrast of day light and night darkness)**

The light during the day has full color spectrum including blue, the sunrise and sunset are in the yellow to red, the brain responds to the composition of the light spectrum and adjusts circadian rythm accordingly. **(tip 3: avoid natural, full spectrum light bulbs and LED lights during the 12 hour night rest period, use yellow light bulbs and dimmers instead)**

There are two hormones that are directly related to sleep. 

Melatonin is a sleep hormone that is secreted by pineal gland after dark with the peak in the middle of the night and absence during the day. The amount and timing of the melatonin is similar for the same person from night to night and this is a reason when people who change time zones experience jet lag over next few days. Melatonin is mostly controlled by the amount of light present and adjustment is slow. 

Cortisol is the stress hormone produced by adrenal glands above kidneys. Cortisol is closely related to quality of sleep. The levels of cortisol peak in regular intervals every hour, in fact lack of these peaks leads to apathy.
