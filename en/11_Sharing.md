How do I write a good post?
You try to achieve few things:
- promote yourself by having something interesting to say
- reference and make friends with others, they might be likely to
  promote you in the future e.g. (e.g. @UkiDLucas)
- promote event, or review URL (e.g. bit.ly, goo.gl)
- promote event #hashtag so people can find more posts about the topic
- write posts in about 120 characters; leave about 20 characters so
  people can quote (re-tweet) your post without shortening it
  Author’s personality
  General guidelines for writing good posts.
- try addressing a particular, narrow list of readers, not the whole world
- in your post provide a real value, it could be a joke
- be yourself, sound sincere and honest
  How Can I Build Online Legitimacy?
  Building legitimacy is one of the most difficult tasks in mass media, you
  know that you have achieved when:
- people follow you without you following them
  48 of 88 pages
- people quote you frequently (re-tweet)
  Here are some common-sense techniques to gain legitimacy:
- research the topic you are posting on, there is nothing more frustrating
  than ignorant comments, you can be wrong, but your opinion should be
  based on solid research
  post tips on the subject you are knowledgable about
  quote smart people - recognizing other’s expertise is a good sign that
  you have some level of understanding
  be careful not to follow stupid trends and people just because everyone
  else is following them
  create videos that add value to your viewers’ lives
  create podcast, 30 minute weekly is a good formula
  be consistent about quality of your posts, but adjust your opinions based
  on new information
  participate in events and workshops, help organize, speak at, book
  signing
  Should I create multiple accounts per social network?
  I prefer to post from a single account and use #hashtags to indicate the
  purpose of my posts. Using single account forces you to maintain certain
  level of integrity that followers will expect from you. In my opinion there is
  no problem with tweeting from single account, people understand you may
  have many interests and are often interested in different aspects of your
  life. There are few things you should remember:
- don’t spam your readers with multiple similar messages
  49 of 88 pages
- keep the tone of your posts consistent, don’t swing from deep
  thoughtful discussions to embarrassingly silly comments
- respect your readers time, if they get annoyed with you, they may not
  want to read you again
  If you think you can be more effective with multiple accounts then go for
  it. Tools like TweetDeck allow you to manage and post from multiple
  accounts without switching screens and logins.
  Should I use automated posting services?
  I usually don’t advise in using programs to post automatically unless the
  content changes and updates to provide value. I have a habit of looking at
  person previous posts and if I see mindless repetition, then I know it are a
  “fake” and ignore it, if I see valuable posts I follow them.
  Recently, I got a Twitter mention from a service that picked up on the
  post about Tower Records, they send me a map URL of nearest Tower
  Record store on their site. Needless to say it was a total miss.
  Monetary value of Microblogging
  Eventbrite.com estimated that posts on social networks sites bring in the
  real monetary value, on average:
  Twitter post brings in $0.80
  Facebook like brings in $1.34
  Who should I follow?
  It is tempting at first to follow anyone you come across, but that strategy
  can quickly backfire. I would recommend following only people who are
  worth following, these don’t have to be people you know personally, but
  they should meet the following criteria:
  when looking back on their posts, make sure they are of quality and
  content you would like to read in the future
  they are respectable individuals, you don’t want to follow sleazy sales,
  haters, vulgar, or otherwise obnoxious people
  follow trend-setters in your area of interest, you want to be the first
  informed person who “finds” and re-tweet some groundbreaking news
  key people to whom our post may provide value
  if you are attending a conference follow all participants, you never know
  who you are going to meet, a week after the conference you can do some
  cleaning up
  What is #FollowFriday or #ff hashtag?
  At the end of each week, on Friday, it is customary and a nice gesture to
  promote people that made the difference in community during that week,
  and to let your followers know who you think is worth following.
  • Promotion, Promotion, Promotion

• take a road less traveled - don’t compete
• re-post experts
• blog about good articles
• ask smart questions
• ask for comments
• show up - even if virtually
In addition to outlined best practices when composing the post keep in
mind the following: Promote yourself among the people you don’t compete
with. I have seen very successful food vendors promoting themselves
among business and technology crowd. You have to “speak their language”
but you should not let them think you compete with them. If you find the
right market they will be happy to promote you.
It is a good practice to re-post experts’ posts with short value-add
comment. There are plenty of people who will just re-post the tweet. I like to
use tools like TweetDeck that allows me to edit the tweet before re-posting.
I like to add couple of words to enhance what was said before. If my
readers see my and other peoples’ re-tweets, I want them to choose mine
to quote.
As you read an interesting articles on the subject pertaining to your
business, it is a good practice to post a short comment, add your thoughts,
complete and enhance on your own business blog and ask for readers
comments along with reference to original article. Smart questions,
especially these not answered in the article work like magic.
Thanks to the fact that we practically live in the virtual world you can
participate in events from around the world. You should follow all major
events around the world that pertain to your business:
anticipate the event with excitement, help organizers promote it
do some research on speakers, promote them
avoid promoting competition, but be curious
during the event follow the participants
re-tweet smart comments and little “gems” of information
add value by providing opinions pertaining to the subject
add bio info about speakers as they speak, people love it
follow up with people and send thank you for the event
#FollowFriday the best contributor
