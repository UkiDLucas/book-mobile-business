# DEVELOPMENT



## Types of applications



There are several distinct types of applications you may choose to develop, each with it’s advantages and disadvantages.
Here is a list in order of specialization:
• Large-screen fully-featured website
• Mobile-optimized website
• Mobile-only website or mWeb
• The mWeb site wrapped in native app
• Write once, deploy everywhere solutions
• A fully native application
In the subsequent chapters we will go over every approach and outline it’s advantages and disadvantages.
For the impatient readers we provide a quick recommendation:
Tip: Do minimum mobile optimization to your existing website (#2) to
remove excess materials and write fully native apps starting with Android
phone at first, then iPhone. Follow up with formatting for tablets.
Explanation:
Modern smartphones have really good browsers that allow reader to
pinch, pan and double-tap to read the content very comfortably.
Optimization for mobile should be limited to putting content in clear
columns that will look nicely when zoomed-in. Don’t forget to remove
excess of advertisements and non-standard content like Flash, which will
get its own chapter soon.
Developing native application as a next step is the best way to provide
your users the best experience possible.
Mobile-optimized Websites (mWeb)
As much as we love developing native applications, for most of people
Mobile Web makes sense as a first step. In USA at least half of websites
are not optimized for mobile, or the process rendered them primitive and
infuriating to the users, for the rest of the world it is true for the most of
sites.
Mobile Web is growing 8 times faster than Internet did at the same age
which back then was called and “explosion for Websites”.
Mobile carrier Internet traffic increased several thousand percent in last
couple of years.
Average mobile smartphone user visits couple dozen of Websites per
day, mostly by news aggregation services.

Full mobile-optimized site vs. dedicated mWeb site
The decision really depends on the resources your company can
dedicate for a long term. There are easy techniques to show smaller
images, hide columns and content that is not optimal for mobile devices, to
hide Flash where it is not supported, but hiding of content usually makes up
for heavy and convoluted code that is difficult to support in a long term. A
lot of companies turn to creating common data services that specify how
much content should be served, and develop “User Interfaces” or UI, for
different devices separately, sharing some of the code libraries and visual
assets.
Who should I hire to develop my project?
I often hear some version of the following:
My friend’s nephew who is a student is willing do this project for $3,500
“just to get experience”. Why should I hire company that charges premium
hourly rates?
We analyzed a couple dozen mobile projects we did for various clients
for where we provided the most value, and the breakdown might be very
unexpected to most people:
Percentage per VALUE provided:
• 35% vision (things you never think of) and project management (PM)
18 of 88 pages
• 20% graphics design, User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)
• 20% development, coding
• 5% Quality Assurance QA and Delivery to market
• 20% Promotion and Marketing (creating Facebook pages, tweeting,
etc.)
As you can see the project that your friend’s nephew could attempt to do
for $3,500 really should cost at least $17,500 and all the things that client
underestimates usually leads to the expensive to fix product failures.
