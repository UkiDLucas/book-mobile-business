Tools for writing this book
We tried several writing software tools, some expensive. We learned that Google Docs, which allow real-time online editing by multiple writers and on various devices have a hard time handling book-size documents, in addition with Google Docs app, editing on the tablet was far from satisfactory. We tried Storyist, StoryMill and other apps, Natalia at one point even formatted the book in Adobe InDesign, but in the end I finished writing this book in Apple Pages with the document saved in Dropbox.
When “on the go”, the Facebook, Twitter, Blogger and Google+ are useful as repository of thoughts, Uki said once paraphrased someone: “I’m writing an eBook on Mobile Business - 140 characters at a time.” eBook Reader vs Paper Book
Regardless of being an avid printed-book lovers, we switched to reading eBooks using Barnes & Noble ePaper Nook, mostly because we read when we travel to client which sometimes amounts to 3 hours a day. You can carry a whole bookshelf with you, when connected you can easily look up new topic in Wikipedia and elsewhere. Right now the author can write a book and publish it as soon as he or she is ready, no more writing for months to publishers and getting dozens of rejections. Publishing is free, can be very profitable (70% of sales). Natalia has been working in magazine publishing for many years and knows that the editors often change the original text to fit their needs. Electronic publishing also assures that you can update the title any time and your readers get the up-to-date version. If you have something smart to share, write an eBook and get published today, don’t wait!
Here are some major advantages:
• you can store hundreds of books. You can read more books at a time and don’t have to carry a back-pack for this
• you can make notes, selections and share the best quotes with friends.
• you can look up for unknown words in the dictionary or internet if available.
• you can read as well as write book reviews
• you can load and read *.pdf files.
• you can adjust the reader to different light conditions you can become your own author, as publishing yours thought, poetry or even recipe book is relatively simple by choosing eBook reader over paper book you contribute improving or at least sparing our ecology as publishing industry is very polluting.
Disadvantages:
considering that this technology is relatively new, not all the books have been converted to eBooks yet, especially old editions. even if you can read for weeks on a battery charge you still have to take care to charge your eBook reader (an often issue for me).
After reading over ten books on the Nook, I had to come back to a paper book only because the edition was not republished since 1967. The reading experience is not very pleasant, though the book is worth it.
First of all, because of the yellowish aged paper the contrast is bad and the font size pretty small and plenty of crooked letters.
Secondly, if you take your sight away or get distracted, because of the small font, it takes quite a while to get back to the place where you stopped reading.
And third, while reading on the train its very difficult to take notes and put your thoughts down.
I am very happy to see that the eBook readers become very affordable.
Barnes&Noble Nook with touchscreen is only $99.
Pros and Cons of self-publishing.
Self-publishing can be accomplished with press-on-demand, eBook, or dedicated eBook app. You should consider it if:
• first time author
• addressing a narrow niche of interest
• have a strong following outside of the main stream media
• limited budget
Publishing with a main stream publishing house makes sense when:
• you are a bestselling author
• you write on main-stream topics e.g. romantic novels
• you need help with marketing, but you are not good social marketer
• you want a recognition that comes with a hardcover edition of your book
• you want to publish large “coffee table” format album
Why an author might choose a custom app?
Author might choose a mobile application in addition to publishing an eBook on Amazon, or with Barnes & Noble because application allows for:
• ability to display up to 3 customized splash screens
• ability to adjust how much of the content readers can share over social
networks
• provide in-app purchases of other books, or future chapters, or sections
• ability to have “about author” page with contact information
• ability to follow Twitter, etc., stream from within the application
• ability to post comments with the built-in #hashtag
• ability to email the author
Daily routine for a writer
Keep quick notes of your idea, since they come in least convenient times like while driving you may need to cary voice recorder. Take notes of all conversations, shows and books. When pressed on time, write a skeleton chapter and come back later to refine it.
We have read about some very successful authors writing daily amount as a single chapter, usually couple pages in length. Many podcast authors write 30 minutes worth of audio per week.
Remember what Richard North Patterson said "Writing is rewriting. A writer must learn to deepen characters, trim writing, intensify scenes. To fall in love with a first draft to the point where one cannot change it is to greatly enhance the prospects of never publishing."
Self-promoting your book
Use social media as outlined in “How Can I Build Online Legitimacy?” It is only a part of the effort to write a book, the major work will be in promoting it, very often publishers will as you about your own strategy of promoting your work and if you don’t have any, they may not want to publish you.
