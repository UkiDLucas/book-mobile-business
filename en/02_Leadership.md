# Leadership

I would like to start this book with some of the qualities you will have to develop as a leader in order to succeed in your enterprise. Without these qualities the chance of success in the long term is minimal.

## Planning and goal setting

Learn to plan. Always have a plan to achieve your next goal. Your goal may be creation of the profitable business, a new shiny product, or a development iteration. 

Start by defining a clear end goal, aim at highest standard. Start breaking the end goals into a list of smaller goals, or milestones that you need to achieve first. List a set of tasks you need to achieve each milestone. Break the tasks into tiny subtasks that you can do in under a week each.

Get familiar with Gantt chart which graphically shows the progression of tasks until you achieve the milestones and end goals. Your subtasks should be so detailed and easy to achieve  in short period of time that traversing the Gantt chart should resemble the long walk down the staircase. The only thing required should be persistence.



Always know what tasks you need to achieve your goal, keep track of the progress towards your goal.

## Surround yourself with smarter people

Understand your limitations, nobody knows everything, surround yourself with people who are smarter than you in the areas that help you accomplish your goals. Keeping bad apples is a costly mistake.

## Educate people

Always educate people. Keeping stuff to yourself makes you a star with a one way ticket out.

Our boss needs to answer his bosses smartly. You need to answer your boss and your team has to provide you with smart answers. New employee need education. Keep the information flow always going, always improving. Document things and keep the knowledge current. Audits happen and lack of knowledge base is a sign of weak leadership.

## Always improve the process

Never be too busy to improve the process.

## Succeed as a manager

I succeed as a leader when my team grows and improves to a point I am no longer neded for them to be successful. There will always be next, better challenge for me.

You lead with what you contribute, not what is your title or knowledge is.

Have mental strengtth and balance, be exacting.

Lead with respect, justice and understanding and cooperation, not brute force.

Provide service to your team, be humble.

Always do more than is required of you.

## Loyalty

Be loyal to your team and expect the same.
