# Leadership

I would like to start this book with some of the qualities you will have to develop as a leader in order to succeed in your enterprise. Without these qualities the chance of success in the long term is minimal.

## Planning and goal setting

Plan, always have a plan to achieve next goal. Always know what tasks you need to achieve your goal, keep track of the progress towards your goal.

Understand your limitations, nobody knows everything, surround yourself with people who are smarter than you in the areas that help you accomplish your goals. Keeping bad apples is a costly mistake.

Always educate people. Keeping stuff to yourself makes you a star with a one way ticket out.

Our boss needs to answer his bosses smartly. You need to answer your boss and your team has to provide you with smart answers. New employee need education. Keep the information flow always going, always improving. Document things and keep the knowledge current. Audits happen and lack of knowledge base is a sign of weak leadership.

Never be too busy to improve the process.

I succeed as a leader when my team grows and improves to a point I am no longer neded for them to be successful. There will always be next, better challenge for me.

You lead with what you contribute, not what is your title or knowledge is.

Have mental strengtth and balance, be exacting.

Be loyal to your team and expect the same.

Lead with respect, justice and understanding and cooperation, not brute force.

Provide service to your team, be humble.

Always do more than is required of you.
