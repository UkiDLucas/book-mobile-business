# Leadership

I would like to start this book with some of the qualities you will have to develop as a leader in order to succeed in your endeavors.

## Planning and goal setting

Learn to plan well. Always have a plan to achieve your next goal. Your goal may be creation of the profitable business, a new product, or a successful software development iteration. 

Start by defining a clear end goal. Once you have a goal, break it into a list of milestones that you need to pass to get there. Then make a list a set of tasks you need to achieve each milestone. Break each tasks into smaller actionable subtasks that you can accomplish without difficulty. If any particular task is to long or too grand, try to break it down further.

Get familiar with Gantt chart which graphically shows the progression of tasks towards the milestones. Your subtasks should be so detailed and easy to achieve in short period of time that traversing the Gantt chart should resemble the long stroll down the staircase. The only thing required should be persistence and the right resources.

### Critical Path

Define a critical path that is the shortest path of absolutely necessary things you need to do to achieve your end-goal. It is nice to have all the bells and whistles, but if they are not getting you directly to your goals, maybe you should not spend time on them.

Reference your plan often as it is very easy to get side-tracked by non-essential things that take you away from achieving your goals.

## Surround yourself with smarter people

Understand your limitations, nobody knows everything, surround yourself with people who are smarter than you in the areas that help you accomplish your goals. Keeping bad apples is a costly mistake.

## Educate people

Always educate people. Keeping stuff to yourself makes you a star with a one way ticket out.

Your boss or client needs to answer his bosses smartly. You need to answer your boss and your team has to provide you with smart answers. New employee need education. Keep the information flow always going, always improving. Document things and keep the knowledge current. Audits happen and lack of knowledge base is a sign of weak leadership.

## Always improve the process

Never be too busy to improve the process.

## Succeed as a manager

I succeed as a leader when my team grows and improves to a point I am no longer neded for them to be successful. There will always be next, better challenge for me.

You lead with what you contribute, not what is your title or knowledge is.

Have mental strengtth and balance, be exacting.

Lead with respect, justice and understanding and cooperation, not brute force.

Provide service to your team, be humble.

Always do more than is required of you.

## Loyalty

Be loyal to your team and expect the same.

Success is the end result, the mastery is the
