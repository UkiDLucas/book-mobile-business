# Search


Search by Gender and family
It is often overlooked that women shop more often for other people, as
much as for themselves, therefore the search might reflect suggestions and
inspirations beyond just single person algorithm, more on that in “Mobile in
Retail” section.
Similar issue arises when a single login account is used for whole family
as in case of movie renting services; based on the previous choices the
suggestion for a father might be whole bunch of children cartoons that
lower relevancy of the whole search.
Finally, most of the men shop with clearly defined purpose. The have
read the product reviews and they just want to buy it - in that case having
them go thru multiple menu levels can be a painful experience.
The Search engine optimization should be done on the full Website from
which user is redirected to the Mobile Web. The full site can be organized
for SEO much better and contain many more relevant keywords.
Searching for Native Applications
The most common way to find the app is to search for it on the app
market, for that the following have to be optimized:
• the name of the application must describe the app perfectly
• the descriptions must use any keywords user might search for
• the images and screenshots have to attractive
• the category and age group has to be appropriate
• use multiple languages if you are offering it internationally
• do not use unnecessary permissions
• Search within the application
The search completion as the user types the keywords is relatively easy
to implement and Google Suggest has API for auto-completion.
If you are working on the finite set of keywords, such as categories or
lists of products I would suggest to load it once on-install to the mobile
SQLite database and update the changes periodically to achieve ultra-fast
experience without the network lag.
Search vs. Traversing Hierarchies vs. Browsing
When users have time they like to browse relevant content, especially
when doing so on the big-screen devices. If you can, try to distinguish the
gender of your user as the search patterns differ.
When users try to buy something but they don’t know the exact name
they might select from the general category, but they might not have
patience to traverse several levels.
When users they know what they want they might search for it, but they
will type the keyword only once, especially when doing so on the virtual
keyboard.
The summary of the behavior is as follows: have the search field right
on top of the home screen, it could be only an icon that when clicked opens
into an input field, remember that Android phones already have the search
button, however tablets might not. In addition to search offer selector menu
to filter the results. Once they use either one, or both you should start
showing relevant results and let them browse. You could detect if they are
pleased with the results and chance the suggestions accordingly. A simple
hot, or not (“thumbs up or down”) functionality would do the job.
Displaying relevant content and other related products on the bottom so
user can keep on going without searching again is usually a good solution.
Finally, remembering user previous searches is very important,
especially ability to change slightly the spelling of the previous search.
Factors that can influence downloads of the
mobile apps
Taking as a fact that you have a great app, a “shouting”, cutting-edge
presence on the app markets, good rating and good promotion, what else
could influence the number of your app downloads?
Having over a dozen apps out on the market, we noticed that every time
we release an update, we have a spike in downloads. The reason is that,
when publishing an update, the app market gives you a bust of ranking so
you get more often in the search results and may be listed on the first page
of rating within the category in which your app belongs to. In addition,
surprising users with improvements (hopefully), either its some new
features or a holiday re-skining of the UI, works as a gentle reminder and
can increase the number of active users which is very important..
Another observation, more obvious this time, is that people tend to
download and explore new apps on weekends.
Here is an example of the downloads statistics on ChildrenTV, on the
right side you see the number of downloads on the left I showed the
weekend days.
Another advise would be - Know your users.
Try to analyze and put yourself in your user’s shoes. Imagine his life
cycle and try to understand at what point you (your app) can be useful.
When is your user more willing to use your product.
Here is an example from the same app, Children TV. Take a guess
which is the reason of a massive increase in downloads on this statistics.
If you pay attention to the dates you will see that on vacation the
downloads are considerably higher, parents are happy to get their kids
busy, kids are happy to watch their favorite cartoons. Boom, mission
accomplished.
I will keep updating this article as I notice new external factors
influencing downloads, full moon for example :).
