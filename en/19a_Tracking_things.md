# Keeping Track of Things with Mobile Technology



## App only solution

The simplest solution to keep track of things is to have a person enter the description of the location, or make a selection from pre-defined options. This method has been used for ages on paper and is still being used daily on mobile computers.

The upgrade to the method is to use Mobile Device's Location service which detects GPS, Wi-Fi and cellular tower triangulation.

## Bar Codes and QR codes

very labor intensive, need to print them. Any phone can scan them with simple library, I have done that many time. Good application for CONSUMERS. For professional use Â (and speed) we use separate RED LASER scanners.

\- NFC stickers: low maintenance and very LOWEST COST, very close range, fast to implement and set up: good if employee uses phone to CATALOGUE items with use of GPS and SHELF location (selection). Can be implement on MOST Android phones for cheap.

\- RFID passive tags: we used them in Sears/KMart warehouses when WHOLE pallets of items had to cross without unpacking. Today you can get several feet radius, good for warehouse. Portable scanners (NOT PHONE) can be used to Catalogue the SHELF location.

\- RFID active tags: think iPass. Expensive.

\- Electronic Devices with GPS and cellular (or satellite) connection are used to track moving tracks, ships and airplanes.
