# Keeping Track of Things with Technology



## App only solution

The simplest solution to keep track of things is to have a person enter the description of the location, or make a selection from pre-defined options. This method has been used for ages on paper and is still being used daily on computers and mobile devices.

The upgrade to the method is to use mobile device's Location service which detects GPS, Wi-Fi and cellular tower triangulation. Sometimes BlueTooth can be used if 10 meter accuracy radius is needed inside buildings where external signals are not reliable.

## Optical Reader

The simplest optical readers only count the passing objects. In modern agriculture we are using optical reader gate to count timing of every seed going into the soil for planting, based on the reading the clutch controlling the speed of seeding can be advanced or retarded. The minute changes are made non-stop as the vehicle slows down and speeds up. Precise planting is essential for the crop yield.

The more advanced robotic systems count and monitor the quality of items passing thru on the assembly line. The similar technique is used in AI systems playing checkers, chess and recently Go games.

In the past we have used optical camera to detect a person (a face), or hand waving in front of the store TV advertisement, or restaurant menu. The technology could change mode from attracting a passerby to a item selection mode.

The most advanced systems can actually recognize the objects such as license plate readers used by police, or security cameras in the airports. These technologies use Machine Learning techniques such as image recognition popularized by Google.



## Bar Codes and QR codes

Bar codes and QR codes look simple, but actually they are very labor intensive solution as the need to be printed. The advantage of using codes is that any phone with optical camera can scan them. With use of a simple code library, the app can be adapted to take advantage of them making it an excellent for consumer applications. Optical camera scanning is slow, for professional use when speed is required we use a separate red laser scanners, which are commonly used in retail stores.

\- NFC stickers: low maintenance and very LOWEST COST, very close range, fast to implement and set up: good if employee uses phone to CATALOGUE items with use of GPS and SHELF location (selection). Can be implement on MOST Android phones for cheap.

\- RFID passive tags: we used them in Sears/KMart warehouses when WHOLE pallets of items had to cross without unpacking. Today you can get several feet radius, good for warehouse. Portable scanners (NOT PHONE) can be used to Catalogue the SHELF location.

\- RFID active tags: think iPass. Expensive.

\- Electronic Devices with GPS and cellular (or satellite) connection are used to track moving tracks, ships and airplanes.
