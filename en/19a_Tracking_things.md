# Keeping Track of Things with Technology



## App only solution

The simplest solution to keep track of things is to have a person enter the description of the location, or make a selection from pre-defined options. This method has been used for ages on paper and is still being used daily on computers and mobile devices.

The upgrade to the method is to use mobile device's Location service which detects GPS, Wi-Fi and cellular tower triangulation. Sometimes BlueTooth can be used if 10 meter accuracy radius is needed inside buildings where external signals are not reliable.

## Optical Reader

The simplest optical readers only count the passing objects. In modern agriculture we are using optical reader gate to count timing of every seed going into the soil for planting, based on the reading the clutch controlling the speed of seeding can be advanced or retarded. The minute changes are made non-stop as the vehicle slows down and speeds up. Precise planting is essential for the crop yield.

The more advanced robotic systems count and monitor the quality of items passing thru on the assembly line. The similar technique is used in AI systems playing checkers, chess and recently Go games.

In the past we have used optical camera to detect a person (a face), or hand waving in front of the store TV advertisement, or restaurant menu. The technology could change mode from attracting a passerby to a item selection mode.

The most advanced systems can actually recognize the objects such as license plate readers used by police, or security cameras in the airports. These technologies use Machine Learning techniques such as image recognition popularized by Google.



## Bar Codes and QR codes

Bar codes and QR codes look simple, but actually they are very labor intensive solution as the need to be printed. The advantage of using codes is that any phone with optical camera can scan them. With use of a simple code library, the app can be adapted to take advantage of them making it an excellent for consumer applications. Optical camera scanning is slow, for professional use when speed is required we use a separate red laser scanners, which are commonly used in retail stores.

The most commonplace use of the bar codes are ISBN number on the books and bar codes on products in retail. QR codes are commonly used in poster advertisements when customer interaction is desired. QR codes can be designed into pretty images.

## NFC stickers

NFC stickers are low maintenance and cost very little, you can order packets of them for cents-per-unit. NFC are very practical when we want to identify things at very close range. The technology is fast to implement and easy to set up, usually you place a sticker on the product and encode it with short information such as serial number of a product, name, or URL, the link could fetch additional metadata via JSON, or XML. 

NFC is an excellent solution if the employee uses phone to catalogue items with use of GPS and shelf location, by selecting location options,  it can be implement on most Android phones without need for external hardware.

The most common use of NFC is in retail for Apple and Google Pay services.

## RFID passive tags

 RF tags are commonly used in retail to detect shoplifting, RF tag is very similar to NFC tag, but has longer range of few feet. They can be coded to represent an item serial number. Passive RF tags are antennas which reflect radio signal of the scanner. 

RF tags are used in warehouses when whole pallets of items have to enter without unpacking. Portable scanners, but unfortunately not standard phones, can be used to catalogue particular item's shelf location.

### RFID active tags

Active RF tags work same way as regular RF stickers, but they are batter operated and can broadcast their signal up to 100 meters. The most common use is the tollway pass (e.g. iPass). They are expensive, therefore applicable only to tracking big items such as containers.

## Electronic Devices with GPS and cellular (or satellite) connection 

These are used to track moving tracks, ships and airplanes. There is a variety of manufactures providing them, but basically they are low voltage, single purpose phones that send the location on per-need basis.
