# Voice Calls

New rules for voice calls
People generally don’t like calls without prior notification
Respect peoples’ time at work, make appointment for the call
Respect peoples’ personal time, don’t call unless you are welcome
Calls from people other than friends and family are often ignored
Get on my Facebook, or contact list to be recognized
Do not leave voice mails, hardly anyone listen to these
Send your name, contact info and bio over the email prior to the call,
don’t give me 5 minute “Hello, my name is… “
