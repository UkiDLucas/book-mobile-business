# Passion for what you do

Real heroes are not the all-powerful characters what movies would want us to believe. They are deeply flawed humans whom, if you meet on the streets you would not regard for much. They are regular folks that are different for the rest only by the fact that they have a deep and unbending passion for their work. Passion is different for everyone and it is shaped by the beliefs instilled in you when you were growing up and by life you have lived. For some, it is conquest of the mountains, for others it is love for creative process.

## Passion is fragile

Maintaing your own passion for work, and especially maintaing the passion of your team is an art. It is very easy to loose motivation because of your bosses shooting down your ideas to improve the process, or bosses being so full of themselves that they simply do not care to hear suggestions from their team. I have been a boss, guilty.

You always have to remember the real reasons you work: 1) to support yourself financially 2) to build a great product 3) to improve yourself. You are not working to please your bosses you are probably not having your your priorities right. In fact if you are not meeting these 3 criteria you need to grow and shed that constraint.

You do not want to be the person everyone dislike, of course, you have to choose your battles wisely, but that is another topic.

You have to care about your own esteem, you have to be happy and grow in your work. 


Will to Work Together


Most of people are just daydreamers. To become a hero, in addition to passion, you need a will to reach out to others to get their help. People can rarely achieve great things alone. Without a true passion a would-be hero will never lighten up a fire in the hearts of others. Passion is the currency of a hero.
You need the people that unlock the closed doors, people with particular skills, or means. They are lending their help allowing you to navigate thru the labyrinth of challenges.


Roadmap to Success


Do you know how to achieve the extraordinary success? Most likely you do not.  The “get education, show up to work on time and work hard many years” is a great recipe to become a good accountant or account manager with predictable inputs and outputs. You cannot map out a path to become a hero, because that path has not been travelled before. 
You will travel the labyrinth of challenges, invariably will take many wrong turns and learn from mistakes, but eventually will come out successful with your passion and help of people who will follow you.
