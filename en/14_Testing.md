# Testing


Multitude of Devices, Screens Sizes and
Orientations
The good news is that if you follow the best practices in graphical
design your application will scale nicely for most of the device versions.
The bad news is that you will need to purchase several devices. At this time
I would recommend at least an iPad2 since it can run iPhone apps. For
Android, I would recommend at least one device with 800x480 pixels
screen, but also 1024x600 and 1200x800 tablets. Please read a section on
screen resolutions about details.
The most obvious solution for most remaining, missing devices in your
personal arsenal are emulators, that is of course if you are not a game
developer, or otherwise using acceleration-meter.
Amount and Cost of Testing
It is normal for any software development project to account for about
20% of total development time for testing. With multitude of different
devices this cost should increase to at least 30% to 40% of the total cost,
especially if the development team is responsible to assure that the
application works on more that most common platforms.
Load Testing
Mobile Web sites should be tested in the similar way as regular sites for
HTML, CSS, JavaScript and graphical assets in addition to how much load
they have on the database, or content management system (CMS).
Mobile applications may have minimal footprint on the server if most of
the user interaction and processing happens in the app, or might have
footprint comparable to the mobile Websites. The advantage of course is
that no user interface elements are being send from the server, unless the
HTML is being generated and “plugged in” as it was in the early versions of
GMail which had vertical list of web browser elements.
