Client


First Phone Call


A new client work usually starts with an email received from a potential
client which is usually followed by a phone call in which we confirm that we
are capable to develop their project. Whether they call us, or we call them,
it is a sales call in which we talk about our accomplishments, best app they
may want to download and invite them to explore our Website. We are also
trying to establish some kind of relationship. In addition to conversation
about our own capacity it is very important to establish that the client is
actually able to pay for the application.
Client’s Ability To Pay
While talking to the client for the first time we are able to figure out how they will finance the project. They have to be able to pay for at least MVP (Minimum Viable Project) so they can present that to investors for the further funding.
From the experience we are able to figure what is the magnitude of the project and we can hint that the project for example may take a month during which time a graphic artist will create assets for at least a week, the developer will spend 2 weeks creating the app, we will test and manage it so the client should be able to compute the cost of 160 hours times our rate. We usually ask how they will fund that and if they have no good answer we try to help them with various options. If the project is just a dream and there is no way to find funding for it the further work should be postponed at this point on our side until that can happen. Client should be capable to clearly know what is the price of the project they are embarking on and how they will pay for it.
First Meeting
We start the new client process by meeting with them, usually in a face-to-face meeting over a coffee for a discussion of what they would like to develop, after that meeting we are able to create an estimate of the cost of the project.
Budgetary estimates
It is important to create a rough budgetary estimate early and present it to the potential client. This can save you a lot of time in the future as they will know what kind of compensation you are expecting.
We have seen many times over idealists who somewhere got the notion that to develop their application can be done for a thousand bucks, probably from the movies where a “hacker” solves a problem in couple of keystrokes.

Another type of people that we are trying to avoid are more savvy businessmen who take advantage of the fact that most developers are not good at monetizing their skill-set and can make them rich for very little.
There is of course the third type, the “horse traders” how get the kick from trying to get the best deal, even if that means a ruin to the developer.
The budgetary estimate sets the correct expectations, shows that your pricing is reasonable and thoughtful and that you are not here to take advantage of the customer, but at the same time you are planning to charge a fair amount for your service.
Native Mobile Platforms
Different needs for different people Apple has a beautiful product consistency with both the hardware and software finely tuned to nicely work together. In addition Apple apps undergo a rigorous review process. This attention to quality assures the top place in the main-stream, one size fit all approach. Apples approach boils down to: if you want a smart phone you can get an iPhone.
Not all people, however, want or need apples, some have a taste for oranges and even lemons.
In the mobile evolutionary race the mainstream Apple maybe the king, but the whole nations maybe be choosing cheaper alternatives. Most first time buyers want phones to check the status of their friends, comment with one-liners and post photos. Most of all they don’t want to pay for their phones, somethings that is not the tune Apple wants to play.
The rest of us may choose varieties of phones that suit their needs better. Many people choose utility of the phone over it’s appearance.
Writing on the mobile phone
As an example of needs that differ from iPhone main stream user can be writing from the phone. I write a lot and it is important to me to write when the idea strikes right on the spot, it is also important to be able to write whenever time allows, the time in front of the computer is usually spent managing the tasks for the team, managing clients, or compiling and testing applications.
The idea of writing on mobile is relatively new, but it is becoming convenient especially with the Blogger, Google+ and Facebook apps. I would not be able to type the long articles on iPhone virtual keyboard, so over the years I experimented with few solutions:
• Motorola Droid phones with keyboard which I loved until they failed to
provide better products
• Apple wireless keyboard connected to phone or tablet
Swiping with finger
• Swiping with a stylus
In the end I have settled on the option of swiping with a stylus using a large, 5.25 inch Galaxy Note as I like large screens and I don’t like carrying the additional tablet in addition to the phone.
