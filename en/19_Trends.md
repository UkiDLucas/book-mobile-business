Transition from Desktop into Mobile
We have been witnessing the move from desktop use to laptops and now to mobile devices. The vast generalization would divide the usage into content consumption on mobile devices and content creation on computer where intensive user input is required. The exception from this rule are cases where mobile is used as crowd-sourcing data collecting tool.
It is safe to say that in not so distant future most of the following will be done PRIMARILY on MOBILE, not desktop:
• reading emails, messaging, checking calendars, contact and task
management
• finding and reading news via dedicated applications, reading eBooks
and ePublications
• Web browsing using social link suggestions
• reading and posting to social media like Twitter, Facebook, Google+
• document management via tools like Google Docs
Tablets and Slate Computers
Tablet are becoming the next personal browsing device. With the success of iPad (~65%) and a nice follow up from Android (~25%) and Windows slates, it is certain that most of the people will find desktops less necessary. Mobile cannot replace all needs desktop provides -- there still are tasks like graphic design and programming that will be done on desktops and laptops for foreseeable future.

People who still will need computers are:

• hardcore gamers
• computation-intensive researchers
Tablet in Meetings
In my career as a software-engineer consultant, I was advising fellow junior consultants not to have an open laptops while in meetings with clients. Psychologically, it was much better to use a quality medium-size notebook and a pen, and to listen attentively to the client while taking notes, even if that was a pure courtesy. Putting a laptop between yourself and client, and typing on, is a borderline or even outright, offensive, unless you can touch-type and look the client straight in the eyes. With the advent of tablet you can take notes, and as long as the display is visible to the person that you talk to, it is very acceptable.
Android in cars
Until now, OnStar is the leader in implementation of mobile systems in cars, the new versions of OnStar are Android-based. It has 6 million users, most of whom pay an average of $240 a year with addition of mobile-phone minutes from Verizon that OnStar resells, GM has more than $1 billion a year in revenue, with double-digit profit margins. Its staff of 2,200 agents answers 99.7 percent of emergency calls within a second, faster than police 911 agents, OnStar says. During GM’s bankruptcy, OnStar was valued between $2 billion and $4 billion.

The field is changing with Saab releasing Android SDK with over 700 inputs from the car to the developers and other companies like Ford are heavily interacting with other mobile systems, mainly for music and contacts management. The field is expected to grow rapidly.
NFC and mobile payments
The filed in which we should expect same great changes are phone-tophone communication with NFC (Near Field Communication), in principle it is not too different from RF (Radio Frequency) tags, just shorter range and in purpose similar to IR (Infra Red) and Bluetooth, however in reality it is much more similar to programmable, super-fast laser bar-code scanner such as those installed in checkout POS (Point Of Sale) register stations.
The power of NFC is commonly undervalued until a person has hands-on ability to interact with technology.
I see NFC, pending iPhone 5 getting on the bandwagon, as the next wave of great innovation in the following areas:
• gift registry: fast scanning of items you like using your own phone and
3rd party applications
• exchange of information between family & friends (music, pictures,
URLs) and business contacts
• fast checkouts (digital wallets)
• rewards programs (coupons and rewards points)
