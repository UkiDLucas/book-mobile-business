## Keep Trying


There is no recipe for successful app, you can improve your adds by hiring best designers, project managers and developers, conduct customer interviews and find best social media marketers, but in the end you will have to try different solutions to see what catches people interest.
Building a product that sells
Let’s focus on the “product” because after all that is what your business is about and what your customers will pay for. Product is what will define all of your future efforts, regardless of what your business philosophy is.
We need to start with dispatching away of the widely quoted statement “build a better mousetrap and people will beat a path to your door” — On rare occasions it’s true, but often engineers create technological marvels that fail to catch on public attention. The process of marketing and selling of your products is very difficult and it should not be ignored in the planning. In this book we will try to provide you the best of our know-how in this matter.
Characteristics of a Good Product
There is no single formula for success; here are few characteristics of a successful application:
it performs the advertised function very well,
it is simple to use according to “Don’t make me think” rule,
it is an eye-candy, designed for a targeted demographic group,
it is well designed for the platform it runs on (phone, tablet),
it induces people to share stuff via social networks,
it is easy to find in application store search,
it provides reasons to use it frequently
it reminds of itself to the user via catchy and inoffensive notifications

Your product should be useful, does not matter if it is a game or a productivity tool, but it should do what it is designed for very well. The product should be very easy to use; any complicated options, confusing messaging, wrong assumptions, functions that take too long to execute are a sure way to lose users. Product should be designed taking in consideration your target demographic. Your product should be designed in such way as to encourage user to share the experience, quotes, images, ratings and comments via your product. Product might remind user of the new content available via notifications. Social sharing is the fastest and easiest way to reach a larger audience. Product should be named well so people can find it, it should provide a good description, if possible, in multiple languages.
Finally, it is always a good idea to build a product that carters to your own needs, knowledge and interests. People often fall into a trap of developing a product based on current fads and fashions, development of a good product is usually a long process and when you are not passionate about it, you probably will fall short of success.
Consumerism
Ever popular, grumpy or cute cats that sing, zombie booths, mindless attention grabbers, full of glitter -- there is a constant flow of products designed to amuse you, They don’t serve any particular purpose, more or less like glass beads in colonization era, they are instant gratification candies. They offer a cheap thrill for few minutes, maybe days if you are a rare person not afflicted with ADD, than they are left unused for what they really are, rubbish. Whole industries work hard to create products that are meant to be replaced as soon as the next wave of fad arrives. It is expensive and wasteful, if this is a line of business you want to be in I have no advice for you.

Classic Products
On the other side of the spectrum are the products that are beautifully designed, serving real purpose. These are the products that you will be happily using for years. They are equivalent of classic cars, which are as pleasing today as they were in their heyday, there are like beautiful houses, quality furniture, or small items like a pocket knife, or a fountain pen that you will pass on to your children. Things you cherish and use, and keep on using for generations.
It is important for us, designers of modern products to go back and ask yourself: 
 Do I provide a lasting value?
