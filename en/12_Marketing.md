# MARKETING


Marketing of you applications
Marketing is not cheap, it takes management effort, design, advertising
and marketing employee time. When you approach a new campaign idea,
whether it is a mobile app that promotes your business, banner ads, blog
post, or social media posts, you should always think about the following:
time wasting: cost of your efforts vs. return on investments (ROI)
work flow for new clients contacting you resulting in new business
search engines: becoming a new trend
URL shortening: services such as bit.ly, goo.gl that follow the trends
It could be a mistake for a company whose name is not widely
recognized to make a cool advertisement and “forget” to emphasize the
company name, or don’t make it easy to follow up. Companies like Nike,
Coca-Cola, etc. are exception.
Marketing to big organizations
When addressing a big organization you should contact as many
diverse people as possible in different departments. You can safely assume
that separate departments lack communication due to busy schedules, lack
of interest and vision, and sadly awful internal politics. If you are lucky
enough that talk about you in a meeting, you better have them all “buttered
up” and prepared:

- “Have you heard about CyberWalkAbout proposal?”
- “Yes, they made a cool Chicago Local Guide app, we should give them
  a call!”
  instead of,
- “No, I’ll check it later”, which almost always means “never“. As always,
  if you send to multiple people a little personalization and human touch goes
  a long way.
  Do Events Influence App Success?
  Not really, sponsoring of the events does not affect the app success.
  We have organized over 40 events and at most we could see a daily
  spike in downloads, but a couple of days after the event metrics were
  coming back to normal growth.
