Monetizing


• free app with ads
• free app; make money on additional services
• free app with in-app purchases
• free limited offer; paid full version
• fully priced version
The first way to make money is to offer your application for free with
advertisements. You should not consider this option, especially using
services like AdMob, if you are not having millions of session. If you want to
try advertisements, there are several options to choose from:
up to 3 full screen splash screens
targeted advertisements sold at premium
generic AdMob style ads
Another good approach is to provide free application and make money
from additional services, which is not that different from the previous
approach, except that you are advertising yourself. This option is
particularly attractive for a consulting businesses, or physical goods sales
organizations. The way to achieve this is by advertising your service, or
product in the application, and having a clear offering in the “About Us”
page. This approach is not recommended for application-as-a-product
company — if you are selling your applications as a product you should
charge money according to the market demand.
One of the most successful way to make money is to provide a good,
free application with in-app purchases. This option is popular with games
where you can purchase currency, weapons, etc., it could also be applied
to digital publishing where reader purchases the full version after the
content preview. Some authors sell books per chapter in this way.
The least recommended approach is to offer the limited version for free
and a fully priced version. Very often basic functionality, or limited time
functionality application is released separately from the fully featured, paid
version. This approach has a very low conversion-to-paid ratio as it
requires the user to go thru extra steps of buying and downloading of an
extra application.
Finally when there is a strong market demand for your application you
should not hesitate to release fully priced version. This option is attractive if
you as a publisher already have the brand recognition and/or the value of
the product is obvious and in demand. There are various schools of thought
regarding the pricing: you can go for maximum market share at a low price,
or get the similar profit at higher price with a limited number of buyers.
Some companies prefer the second option as the amount of customer
service required is lower and customers who pay more are generally more
satisfied with the product than customers who receive it at a deep discount,
or for free. The prestige of the company with higher price could also be
elevated, but it should be a case-by-case decision with a consideration for
competition offerings , market maturity and other relevant factors.
Advertisement placement and customer perception
There are several common ways to place advertisements:
• splash screens
• banner ads (AdMob)
• product and service screens (About Us screen)
• ad incorporated in the views (ads in games)
All of these types of adds are acceptable if designed well, with
exception for banner ads that can drastically lower the perception of quality
of your application.
