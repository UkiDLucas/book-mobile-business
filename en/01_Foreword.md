## About the title

Every company today is a software company. For most, the most convenient way to reach their client is via mobile: be it a web browser or dedicated app. Looking back into countless mobile projects for many companies, the most important question for the top consultant is what is this particular company's mobile road map. Why road map? The resources are scarce, sometimes there are couple of dedicated developers, sometimes a whole team, but there are always more ideas (a backlog of ideas) then what can, or should be implemented.

## The real need for this book



It has been said many times that the best way to create something of value is to address your own pressing needs. It is also true for this book. Developing mobile applications with a group of people from around the world creates a need to share and manage not only tasks, but also the **organizational culture**.
Maintaining this book in addition to keeping a blog and GitHub account allows me to have a living knowledge repository as well as share it with you via your favorite eBook reader.

## Who Should Read This Book

This book was written from my hands-on couple of decades of experience as A Marine, automotive mechanic, software developer, technology director, UX expert, architect in fortune 500 and owner of the small 12 person startup, therefore we can advise only what I know. 

If you look for information about finance, taxation, sales, legal issues pertaining running a company you will have to get additional help.  I am really bad at these..
