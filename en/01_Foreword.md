# FOREWORD

## Flat out



Monday. The weekday alarm wake me up at 2:45 AM, I forgot to change it from the Friday’s server deployment day. I quickly resumed the sleep broken by many thoughts, mostly about what time it is. 

At 6 AM the second alarm on my trusty Timex Triathlon woke me up, I have both Apple Watch, Samsung Tizen and Google Wear Moto360, but they are not reliable if you do not religosly charge them.

Very unusually for myself, as I am ealry raiser, I ignored it and my wife took the advantage to go to the shower first. Fifteen minutes later was my turn, I went to the bathroom, brushed my my teeth and before jumping to the shower I felt the weird hungry dizziness from my stomach. I went downstairs to the kitchen. “Strange” - my wife thought, “he never does that”. 

I got a glass of milk — the liquid full of sugar, fats and proteins, I thought, will rehydrate me and give me a little boost. I took a sip and sat down on the couch in the dining room. 

Or at least I thought I did, grandma woke up to a thud of my body hitting the ground in the middle of the floor and broken glass shattering. I had no idea, I hit the deck. 

I've terrified my family, my body unresponsive, twitching, my wife Natalia and grandma screaming at me, trying to wake me up, pumping my chest. 

I did come to once, lifted myself on the hand and collapsed again, unconscious. 

The previous week my heart was all pins and needles.

I came to again just to see my wife trying to use my phone to call 911, the microphone does not work on my OnePlus One Andorid phone, I told her with some clarity of mind about the phone, but in fact I lost sense of time and place. I am not sure what happened and when. I remember my year-and-a-half daughter, Zoe, leaning on my chest right above my face and I really loved that sight, my little angel, gently tapping me on the face. 

The emergency guys came very fast, we live around the corner from town's fire department, by then I was very conscious and despite being ghostly white on my face I was recovering. 

Over next 2 days doctors performed a full set of tests on me: CAT scan of my head, X-Ray of my chest and Echo Cardio Gram. I was released the following day after passing the stress test (treadmill run uphill) while connected to EKG and table tilt test. I did not have a heart failure. 

It was stress.

The previous week was a nightmare, constant software issues, constant state of fight-or-flight, constant email chains from the management, long 12-14 hour days, 20 people to manage.   

The previous Friday was the pinnacle, deployment in the early morning, hence getting up at 2:45 AM, status calls, more issues and a very long pep-talk from the big boss on what was wrong and how I can improve, personally. I came back home at 6 PM. 

On weekend I mostly slept, then had a good dinner out on Sunday and went sleep very early preparing for the next glorious week. I took 2 Advil PM tablets to make sure I can fall asleep at 7 PM. Monday morning my blood pressure was too low, heart too stressed, my body gave up — passing out is body’s natural reaction to protect the brain from lack of oxygen. I’ve totally wrecked my system to a point that 4 days of bed rest (including hospital) had no effect, at the moment of this writing my heart still hurts, I am still aware I might find myself on the floor at any moment, or worse.

Lesson 1 learned: Take care of your health.

Lesson 2: Do not let bad managers bring you down for profits.



## The real need for this book



It has been said many times that the best way to create something of value is to address your own pressing needs. It is also true for this book. Developing mobile applications with a group of people from around the world creates a need to share and manage not only tasks, but also the **organizational culture**.
Maintaining this book in addition to keeping a blog and GitHub account allows me to have a living knowledge repository as well as share it with you via your favorite eBook reader.

## Who Should Read This Book

This book was written from my hands-on couple of decades of experience as A Marine, automotive mechanic, software developer, technology director, UX expert, architect in fortune 500 and owner of the small 12 person startup, therefore we can advise only what I know. 

If you look for information about finance, taxation, sales, legal issues pertaining running a company you will have to get additional help.  I am really bad at these.
