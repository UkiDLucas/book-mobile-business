# Company


Company size & culture
When you decide to develop your company you have some important
choices to make, many people measure the success by how much
revenues the company brings and how many people work for them. After
working in couple of very large corporations I developed certain level of
dislike to politics and bureaucracy, I also like to know personally people I
work with and treat them as a family with whom I choose to spend most of
my waking hours. Over the years, the lifestyle became very important to me
too; I am realizing that opportunities for me to ski the slopes, climb the
mountains and dive the reefs will get scarcer and scarcer, therefore I am in
need to build a company that can proclaim a “ski day”, or a “field trip”
without worrying about investors, partners or hundreds of employee.
It is widely known that small teams can accomplish greater things than
big, slow and committee-driven companies. It may sound not ambitious, but
my ambition is to build a smallest-possible company with a handful of
friends that makes plenty of money without a need of big human overhead.
Collaboration Website
Over the years we have learned that keeping a private, project
collaboration site is essential. I have used several solutions from
SharePoint, through Wikis and BaseCamp, but one of the simplest to use
and most practical is Google sites.
On the collaboration site you post screenshots of the newest versions
and graphical assets for the next iterations of the product. Also, you include
the documentation, use cases and problem descriptions.
The site, when well organized is an excellent tool to update customer on
work in progress: “Can you look at page 3.a - product details?”
We try to create a page for each piece of functionality.
It is important to put most recent screenshots on top of the page, and it
is easy to see pervious versions as you scroll down. Other, non visual files
can be attached.
Another trick is to set page layout in two columns, which Google sites
allow you to do easily. Left column is for developers to post the current
state and the right column for artists to show the vision of what it should be.
A great site saves a ton of confusion and delays. We literally prohibit our
people from sending Word Docs, images, Spreadsheets, etc. via email, or
Skype. All useful documentation should be posted for sharing with update
alerts and revision history available.
Importance of pair-programming
The idea of pair-programming makes sense for several reasons, first of
all almost always when the developer “bounces” ideas against someone
else, they end up thinking through the problem more carefully than a single
person who would implement the first idea that comes to mind.

Secondly, the pair, when indoctrinated well cuts much less corners and the product quality increases.
Thirdly, when you loose a developer, and it is not always by “got hit by a bus” but sometimes a happy “got married and went for a honeymoon”, then the other developer understands nuances of the project and can continue.
Finally, when you have a nice team, it is simply more fun to get together and solve the problems.
I have build very smart and effective teams in the past composed of senior and very junior members that did great work, enjoyed coming to work and did tours on local microbreweries together -- now, that is priceless.
Not all people like to work in pairs, my answer to that is, try to build teams composed of people who do. You will not regret loosing one loner mad scientist whose work might worked brilliantly, but whose code had to be re-writen anyway once he left.
Talking from experience. Good programmers like to share and have fun while doing an awesome job
Break the Organizational Walls
When you hire different people to do a project for you, make sure they literally work together. Throwing the work over-the-fence always results in a mediocre product. Let me explain.
You hire the best design team and they indeed do a stellar work. You are happy so you give the designs to some brilliant development team.
They start working with the design and realize that you are missing the crucial data to fill out parts of the design, now the product is not as good. To make things worse you start testing the app and learn that the customer interaction flows are slightly different then envisioned which is always the case as customers are not able to tell you what the like and dislike before they see and touch it. Your development team is pressed by the timeline, no designer around, so they photo-chop the original desing to fit the new needs. The monster is born with the intention of fixing it later. Fixing it later never happens.
Get design and technology people in the same room from beginning to the end of the development, or fail.
